# ü¶Ñ Automatically writes unit tests for your projectü¶Ñ
**Ponicode Unit Test GitHub Action** is an action that automatically raises your testing coverage by generating the Unit-Tests of your files in all you Pull-Requests!

**Ponicode Unit Test GitHub Action** is the newest tool on the Ponicode platform to accelerate developers on their code quality journey

**Combined with [Ponicode SQUAR Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ponicode-squar)**, you can generate Unit-tests on files that require it based on Ponicode SQUAR report  

# üí• Benefits

- __RAISE YOUR CODE QUALITY FAST__ - Accelerate the remediation of your code quality weaknesses on your high risk functions
- __FIND YOUR PRIORITIES__ - Prioritize your code quality efforts by combining Ponicode Unit Test action together with [Ponicode SQUAR Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ponicode-squar)


# üîé How does it work
- Ponicode Unit Test GitHub Action enables you to accelerate your coverage catch-up by generating missing unit tests, test cases and edge cases on your PR files.

# üò≥ Why should I use this GitHub Action
- Keep your codebase at a high test coverage
- Reduce the chances of facing bugs in production

# ‚öôÔ∏è How to setup this action

### If you didn't do before, init ponicode on your project:
```
npm install -g ponicode
ponicode init
```
In case you develop in a language that is supported by Ponicode TurboCov Dashboard, those commands will create a ```ponicode.config.json```. This file has to be indexed in your git repo. It permits you to have all your code quality insights available in your TurboCov Dashboard [here](https://app.ponicode.com/turbo-cov/projects/)

### If it does not exist, create a yaml workflow file in your project

Add the following lines to any of your Github Action workflow.

Go to the root of your project, and create the path to your workflow file. For example
```
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```
You can also just create a folder named ``.github``, in it create another folder named ``workflows``. You can now create a YAML file named **``ponicode.yml``** and copy one of the following example in it! <br />

### Existing workflow
Here is what you must add in your ```.github/workflows/ponicode.yml``` file to activate and use Ponicode Unit-Testing Action  to trigger the action.

```yaml
jobs:
  ponicode:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - run: |
        npm install -g ponicode
        npm i --save-dev rewire @types/rewire jest@26 ts-jest@26 @types/jest
    
    # Identify which files are impacted by the Push / PR
    - id: get_changed_files
      uses: jitterbit/get-changed-files@v1
      continue-on-error: true
      with:
        format: 'json'

    # Extract branch name
    - id: extract_branch
      if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
      run: echo "::set-output name=BRANCH_NAME::$(echo ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF})"
    
    # Run Ponicode Unit Test Action
    - uses: ponicode/unit-testing-action@master
      with:
        repoURL: ${{github.repository}} # DO NOT MODIFY
        branch: ${{ steps.extract_branch.outputs.BRANCH_NAME }} # DO NOT MODIFY
        githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # DO NOT MODIFY
        ponicodeUtToken: ${{ secrets.PONICODE_TOKEN }} # DO NOT MODIFY
        impactedFiles: ${{ steps.get_changed_files.outputs.added_modified }} # DO NOT MODIFY IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE TESTS ON PR IMPACTED FILES ONLY
        commentUTs: "false"
```
### Once configured, this workflow:

1. bootstraps the unit-tests for the functions included in the PR into a dedicated new PR
![Unit-tests generation workflow](https://ponicodefilesstorage.blob.core.windows.net/githubaction/gif_UT.gif)

**Optionally**, combined with [Ponicode SQUAR Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ponicode-squar), it gives the following workflow (See Use-Cases section hereafter for more details)
![SQUAR + Unit-test generation workflow](https://ponicodefilesstorage.blob.core.windows.net/githubaction/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif)


### Ponicode Unit Test Action parameters
| Name | Description | Required | Default |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| ``ponicodeUtToken`` | This parameter has to be configured as **``PONICODE_TOKEN``** in Repository Github Secrets. The token can be retrieved on [Ponicode UT Generation App](https://app.ponicode.com/github-actions/token). | Yes if ``bootstrapUT`` is set to ``true``, No if not | No default. This parameter has to be set-up in your GITHUB SECRETS (see below on how to do that) |
| ``impactedFiles`` | Indicate on which files, Unit-Tests have to be generated | Yes | Default value is the output of ``get-changed-files`` step. When Combined with [Ponicode SQUAR Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ponicode-squar), the parameter is ``${{ steps.ponicode_squar.outputs.impacted_files }}`` |
| ``commentUTs`` | Set to ``"true"`` to comment the genrated Unit-Tests, ``"false"`` if not. | Yes | Set to ``"false"`` by default. | 
| ``githubToken`` | **Required if Ponicode SQUAR is activated** This parameter has to be configured as **``GITHUB_TOKEN``** in Repository Github Secrets. The token can be retrieved on [Ponicode SQUAR App](https://squar.ponicode.com/token). | Required if you want SQUAR analysis to be activated | No default. This parameter has to be set-up in your GITHUB SECRETS (see below on how to do that) |

**NB: all the other parameters must be let un-changed, since they are automatically filled-in from previous steps in the workflow**
- ``repoURL``
- ``branch``
- ``githubToken``

# üßê Examples of SQUAR reporting in Pull-Requests
When combining [Ponicode SQUAR Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ponicode-squar) together with Ponicode Unit Test Action in your workflow, you get immediate feedbacks on the quality of your tests for the files impacted by the PR:
### List of Testing Quality alerts on files impacted by a PR

### Ponicode SQUAR report on the whole project
With [Ponicode SQUAR Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ponicode-squar), you can also have exhaustive report on the quality of your tests for the whole project:

# ü§î What is a critical piece of code ? 
Ponicode research and development work enables us to fine tune a proprietary formula to spot the most important functions of your codebase. This formula is based on how much of an impact the function has on the overall behavior of your application. This translates into getting a better visibility over how likely a weakness in a function could generate an impactful bug for your software. Still unsure about what makes a high risk function? Here‚Äôs 2 weighted elements we put into our equation.
- __Complexity to Repair__: Measure of how difficult a function is to intuitively understand and modify. This measure is between 0 and 1
- __Impact of a function on the code-base__: Measure of how much the function is used in the project. This measure is between 0 and 1

**This technology is implemented in [Ponicode SQUAR Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ponicode-squar)**
